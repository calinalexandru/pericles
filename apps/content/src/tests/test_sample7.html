      The world of web development is constantly evolving, with new technologies
      and practices emerging regularly. As developers, it's essential to stay
      updated and adapt to these changes to create efficient and user-friendly
      web applications. From the rise of responsive design to the importance of
      user experience, the web continues to be a dynamic and exciting field.

      Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
      non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2]
      Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content
      changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

      For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist
      of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like
      Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations
      may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary
      assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or
      information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative
      effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
      department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
      front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3]
      Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in
      the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4]
      Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has
      become one of the most used technologies ever.
