	It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was
	the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it
	was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were
	all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way â€“ in short, the period was so far like the present
	period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
	degree of comparison only.

	There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a
	large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the
	lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.

	It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to
	England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed
	birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that
	arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a
	dozen years after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in
	originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and
	People, from a congress of British subjects in America: strange to relate, have proved more important to the human
	race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.

	France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with
	exceeding smoothness downhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she
	entertained herself with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out
	with pincers, his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of
	monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards.
